Ungaruda-ify Garuda Linux.


Garuda Linux is a arch-based distro that makes Arch easy-to-use.

the problem is: it comes with default firefox extensions and apps made by the garuda team, and sometimes it is annoying.

So I made this app to remove every garuda app, and maybe replace it with a Non-garuda app.
